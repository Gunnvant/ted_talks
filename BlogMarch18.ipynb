There is one issue with such a representation of text though, it doesn't take into account the importance of words in a document. For example, the word \"one\" occurs only once in the document 1 but is missing in the other documents, so from the point of view of its importance, \"one\" is an important word for document 1 as it characterises it, but if we look at the count vector for document 1, we can see that \"one\" gets of weight of 1 so do words like \"This\", \"is\" etc. Issues, regarding the importance of words in a document can be handled using what is known as ***Tf-Idf***. \n",

The product of these two quantities, measures the importance of the word and is known as **Tf-Idf**. Creating a tf-idf representation is fairly straightforward, if you are working with a machine learning frame-work, such as scikit-learn, it's fairly straighforward to create a matrix representation of text data \n",
